# fullstack-part-2
My solutions to the exercises in part 2 of the Full Stack Open 2019 course. To run this project, you need to run `npm install` first to install packages (such as JSON server) after you cloned/downloaded it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Starts a JSON server on port 3001 needed to fetch data from the database. Run this in a separate commandline window at the same time as `npm start`.
